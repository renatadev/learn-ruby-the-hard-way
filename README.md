# Renata's journey through "Learn Ruby the Hard Way" book

I'll be uploading my exercises files as I go along, 
while learning how to use GitHub at the same time! 

You can find the book/guide [here.](https://learnrubythehardway.org)

I have completed **19/52** exercises.

## R u b y  E x t r a s:

- I've completed the 'Learn Ruby' track on Codecademy.
- I've read 'Learn to Program' by Chris Pine.
